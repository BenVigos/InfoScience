Week 29

What we did:
 Dove deeper into for loops. Did some exercises, for example printing x "bears" where x was the number of the for loop iteration.

 We continued our simulation by adding infected individuals and counters for the healthy, the infected and the number of iterations.

What I learned:
 Nothing new yet
 
Questions I have:
 Yes:
How can we check the distance between a circle and every other circle?
I suppose that we would need to create two lists? One for the healthy and one for the infected?

 
Homework for next class:
 The for loop tasks 1. 2. and 3. will be submited as photographs
